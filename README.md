# C++ Projects â€“ Learning by Comparison

This repository is for learning C++ by drawing parallels with C and Python.  
The goal is to help you understand C++ syntax and features, especially if you already know C or Python.

## 01C++explainer.cpp

The first file, `01C++explainer.cpp`, is a simple Student Management System.  
It demonstrates key C++ features compared to C and Python, with detailed comments throughout the code.  
You will see both automatic object creation (for example, Alice and Bob are added automatically) and interactive input (adding more students via the console).

**From the code comments:**

> This example demonstrates key C++ features compared to C and Python.  
> These features make C++ safer and more expressive than C, while offering more control and efficiency than Python.

**To compile and run:**
```sh
g++ -std=c++11 [01C++explainer.cpp](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) -o student_management
./student_management 
```

## What's Next
More files will be added to this project, each exploring different aspects of C++ syntax and functionality.
Stay tuned for examples covering advanced topics, best practices, and more comparisons with C and Python!
